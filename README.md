# Capstone Project Proposal 


**How do we predict revenue?** How do revenue numbers lead to insights about the user journey? <!--- what is a user journey? Your audience doesn't know --> How do we operationalize these insights into the optimized the user journey? <!--- avoid casual language -->

The idea is to translate data insights into executive level insights that will shape the fabric of my client. <!--- what is fabric of a client? avoid jargon -->

This analysis will be an ecosystem unto itself that will be partitioned into 6 steps:

  1). It begins with data acquisition, data validation, data normalization, and then I will utilize subject matter experts to apply checks & insights along the way.

  2). The second step to this project will be data visualization, exploratory analysis utilizing PCA, and model selection.
  
  3). Once the model is selected we will select our hyperparameters, data preparation methods, and then deploy the model - testing many different avenues.
  
  4). After our prediction model is complete, we can extract variable importance and use a combination of regressions and correlation matrices to validate our constructs.
  
  5). The fun part will be to translate our constructs into a return on investment for the client by extracting operational insights for the c-suite & experience optimization team.
  
  6). And finally, we will deploy these insights into a monthly key performance indicator tracker that will utilize Tableau & R's visualization software that the chief marketing officer can access at any time she desires. 
  
  This build is develop new, cutting edge KPIs for our client, and to align the vast empire of internal and external teams & partners to all row in the same direction.
